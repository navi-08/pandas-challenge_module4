**Spending Ranges (Per Student):**

- **<$585:** Schools here have the highest math (83.46) and reading (83.93) scores and the best passing rate (90.37%). They also excel in math (93.46%) and reading (96.61%).

- **$585-630:** Schools in this range have slightly lower math (81.90) and reading (83.16) scores. The overall passing rate is 81.42%, with 87.13% passing math and 92.72% passing reading.

- **$630-645:** Schools in this range score 78.52 in math and 81.62 in reading. The overall passing rate drops to 62.86%, with 73.48% passing math and 84.39% passing reading.

- **$645-680:** Despite the highest spending, schools in this range have the lowest math (76.99) and reading (81.03) scores. The overall passing rate is 53.53%, with 66.16% passing math and 81.13% passing reading.

**Scores by School Size:**

- **Small (<1000):** Small schools lead in math (83.82), reading (83.93), and overall passing rate (89.88%). They also shine in math (93.55%) and reading (96.10%).

- **Medium (1000-2000):** Medium-sized schools have slightly lower math (83.37) and reading (83.86) scores but a solid overall passing rate (90.62%). Math (93.60%) and reading (96.79%) performances are strong.

- **Large (2000-5000):** Large schools have the lowest math (77.75) and reading (81.34) scores. The overall passing rate is 58.29%, with 69.96% passing math and 82.77% passing reading.

**Scores by School Type:**

- **Charter:** Charter schools outshine district schools with higher math (83.47) and reading (83.90) scores. The overall passing rate is 90.43%, with 93.62% passing math and 96.59% passing reading.

- **District:** District schools lag behind with lower math (76.96) and reading (80.97) scores. The overall passing rate is 53.67%, with 66.55% passing math and 80.80% passing reading.

In summary, lower-budget schools perform well. Smaller and medium-sized schools outperform large ones. Charter schools excel in all subjects compared to district schools.
Summarizes the analysis:

- The dataset encompasses 15 schools and 39,170 students, revealing trends in academic performance based on various factors.
- Reading scores and passing rates consistently outshine math scores and passing rates across schools.
- Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in both math and reading.
- Smaller and medium-sized schools tend to excel in math performance and overall passing rates compared to large schools.
- Schools with lower per-student budgets often achieve higher overall passing rates.
- Cabrera High School stands out as the highest-performing school with a remarkable 91.33% overall passing rate.

Two correct conclusions or comparisons from the analysis:

1. **Charter vs. District:** Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in both math and reading, showcasing the potential benefits of alternative education models.

2. **Budget Impact:** Schools with lower per-student budgets tend to achieve higher overall passing rates, challenging the assumption that higher budgets directly correlate with better academic outcomes. This suggests that efficient resource allocation is critical for student success.
